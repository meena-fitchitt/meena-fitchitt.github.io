## Welcome to my Website

I am currently a Sales Associate for Xfinity. I have a bit over 2 years in customer service experience as well as 6+ months of sales experience. Currently, I am looking to pursue a bachelor's degree in computer science to become a web developer. I have experience using HTML as well as CSS and I have some basic experience with JavaScript. 

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Experience

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/meena-fitchitt/meena-fitchitt.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
